# ZK Filter
ZK filter is a library for efficient and easy-to-use set exclusion zero-knowledge proofs.

Set exclusion proof is a technique that enables one party to prove to another party that a particular item is not a member of a set without disclosing any additional information about the set or its contents.

## ZK bloom filter
[bloom filter](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/362686.362692) is a space and computationally efficient probabilistic data structure that enables membership queries with a certain probability of false positives. It returns "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set." This ZK implementation provides Bloom filter-like features while also possessing zero-knowledge properties for both insert and membership check operations.

### Usage 
ZKBF can be use where some error is acceptable or handleable.

### to be continue :)
feel free to open issue to request others feature.

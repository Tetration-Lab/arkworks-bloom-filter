# ZK Filter
ZK filter is library for efficient and easy to use set exclusion zero knowledge proof. 

Set exclusion proof is a technique that allows one party to prove to another party that a specific item is not a member of a set without revealing any other information about the set or its contents.

## ZK bloom filter
[bloom filter](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/362686.362692) is a space and compute efficient probabilistic data structure that allow membership query with some probability of false positive aka it will return "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set". This ZK implementation allow bloom filter like feature while also have zero knowledge property on both insert and membership check. 

### Usage 
ZKBF can be use where some error is acceptable or handleable.

### to be continue :)
feel free to open issue to request others feature.
